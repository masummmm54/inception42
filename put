Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: standalone). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: muhakose.42.fr
  Type:   dns
  Detail: DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up A for muhakose.42.fr - check that a DNS record exists for this domain; DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up AAAA for muhakose.42.fr - check that a DNS record exists for this domain

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to download the challenge files from the temporary standalone webserver started by Certbot on port 80. Ensure that the listed domains point to this machine and that it can accept inbound connections from the internet.

Some challenges have failed.
